ðŸ§  MNIST Digit Classification with Live Drawing ðŸŽ¨
This project demonstrates a machine learning model trained on the MNIST dataset that can classify hand-drawn digits. You can draw a digit live using your mouse, and the model will predict it in real-time.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

.
â”œâ”€â”€ digit_model_train.py       # Trains and saves the model
â”œâ”€â”€ digit_model_live.py        # GUI to draw and predict digits live
â”œâ”€â”€ digit_model.h5             # Saved trained model
â””â”€â”€ README.md
ðŸ”§ Requirements
Install the dependencies:


-------------pip install tensorflow pillow numpy matplotlib---------------------

ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Train the Model
If you don't already have the model:

-----------python Mnist.ipynb--------------------

This will create a file called digit_model.h5.

2. Run the Drawing GUI
b
---------python digit_model_live.py--------------
A window will open where you can draw digits using your mouse.

Press "Predict" to classify the digit.

Press "Clear" to erase the canvas.

ðŸ§  Model Info
Architecture: Simple Neural Network with Dense layers

Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits

Accuracy: ~98% on test data


ðŸ’¡ Tips for Better Accuracy
The model expects 28Ã—28 grayscale images with white digits on black background.

Drawing with thicker strokes (radius ~20 px) gives better results.

Avoid very small or thin digits while drawing.
